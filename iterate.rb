# 1. Here's a list of all of Alex's favorite foods. For each food in the list, print out a statement that says "I really love _____" and then fill in the blank with each.
favorite_foods = ["Sushi", "Pizza", "Salmon", "Tamales dulces", "Yuca fries", "Apple pie", "Katsu curry", "Shrimp and grits", "Waffles"]



# 2. Now for each food in that list, let's be specific about how MUCH Alex likes them.
# For example, print out "Alex's #1 favorite food is Sushi" and then "Alex's #2 favorite food is Pizza" and so on until you've made an ordered list.
# This can be done a number of different ways, but the easiest is probably the ruby `.each_with_index` method. Consider finding that in the documentation.




# 3. Below is a massive array of numbers. Iterate over the array and print out only the even ones.
many_numbers = [109, 141, 44, 51, 133, 366, 339, 248, 226, 321, 97, 195, 245, 252, 238, 1, 366, 47, 189, 91, 148, 88, 194, 106, 5, 128, 165, 337, 380, 181, 143, 95]



# 4. Below is a list of 99 names. Iterate over the array and find the longest name in the whole list. Then print out "The longest name in the list is ______. It has ___ letters in it."
many_names = ["Alexa","Burke","Kasimir","Baxter","Carissa","Vielka","Derek","Jemima","Jackson","Keegan","Graham","Melissa","Jeanette","Grant","Kirsten","Naida","Brody","Ishmael","Kane","Seth","Rae","Eagan","Camille","Alana",
  "Vance","Melinda","Tarik","Risa","Jordan","Camilla","Karly","Baker","Adena","Calvin","Kendall","Nasim","Kellie","Dana","Rhoda","Linus","Tyler","Ahmed","Dante","Shay","Lael","Tana","Claudia","Chadwick","Tara",

# 5. Take that same array and sort them into two lists: one list of long names, which have more than 6 characters, and one list of short names which have 6 or fewer characters. Then print out both lists.
